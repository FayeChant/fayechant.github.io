Agent Based Model
=================

*Description*

This model allows a number of agents to move around a specified environment at random. 
They can eat from the environment until they are "full". The final environment is exported from the tool.
A GUI is provided to run the model, and an animation is shown as the agents are moving and eating.

*Code*
